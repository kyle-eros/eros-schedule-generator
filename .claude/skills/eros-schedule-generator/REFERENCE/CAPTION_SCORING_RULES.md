# Caption Scoring Rules Reference

## Purpose & Critical Warning

This document catalogs observable patterns from **160 highest-earning captions** across the EROS creator network. These patterns represent what HAS worked for specific creators in specific contexts, not what MUST work universally.

### ⚠️ ANTI-PATTERIZATION MANDATE ⚠️

**Pattern X works for Creator A ≠ Pattern X works for Creator B**

All patterns documented here are:
- **DESCRIPTIVE** (what has earned revenue)
- **CONTEXT-DEPENDENT** (creator + timing + audience state)
- **TEMPORALLY-AWARE** (patterns decay with overuse)
- **NEVER PRESCRIPTIVE** (no universal templates)

**Core Philosophy**: Caption effectiveness is creator-relative and temporally-bound. A pattern that earned $20,000 for Creator A last month may earn $0 for Creator B today, or even $0 for Creator A next month if overused.

**Version**: 1.0
**Created**: 2025-12-19
**Data Source**: 160-caption analysis across 37 active creators
**Analysis Period**: 90-day rolling window

## Diversity Score Thresholds Table

Diversity score measures caption uniqueness relative to creator's recent history.

| Score Range | Classification | Rotation Window | Weekly Limit | Penalty/Bonus |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------|--------------|---------------|
| 1.0 | Unique | 45-60 days | 1 per week | +10 points |
| 0.80-0.99 | High diversity | 30-45 days | 2-3 per week | +5 points |
| 0.60-0.79 | Mid diversity | 14-21 days | 2 per week | 0 points |
| 0.40-0.59 | Low diversity | 10-14 days | 1 per week | -10 points |
| <0.40 | Template | 7-10 days | AVOID | -15 points |

**Calculation Method**:
```python
diversity_score = 1.0 - (
    (structural_similarity * 0.40) +
    (language_similarity * 0.30) +
    (emoji_similarity * 0.20) +
    (length_similarity * 0.10)
)
```

**Application Rules**:
- **High diversity (0.80+)**: Prioritize in selection, eligible for premium sends
- **Mid diversity (0.60-0.79)**: Standard rotation, safe for most send types
- **Low diversity (0.40-0.59)**: Use sparingly, avoid premium PPVs
- **Template (<0.40)**: Reject unless emergency/fallback scenario

**Penalty Calculation**:
```python
if caption_length outside optimal_range:
    chars_outside = abs(caption_length - nearest_optimal_boundary)
    penalty = (chars_outside // 50) * penalty_per_50
```

**Example**:
- Send type: `ppv_unlock` (optimal 250-449, penalty -15 per 50 chars)
- Caption length: 550 chars
- Outside by: 550 - 449 = 101 chars
- Penalty: (101 // 50) * -15 = 2 * -15 = **-30 points**

## Scoring Factor Weights

### Primary Scoring Factors

These weights determine caption selection priority after HARD FILTERS (vault matrix + AVOID tier exclusion) are applied.

| Factor | Points | Description | Calculation Method |
|--------|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Structural Pattern Match** | 0-30 | Presence of proven structural patterns | Alert emoji (+10), Duration (+10), Enumeration (+10) |
| **Language Power Signals** | 0-25 | High-impact language elements | Superlatives (+8), Climax (+8), Authenticity (+5), Intimacy (+4) |
| **Length Optimization** | 0-20 | Character count within optimal range | Within optimal (+20), Near optimal (+10), Outside (0 to -30) |
| **Temporal Freshness** | 0-15 | Days since last use by this creator | 60+ days (+15), 30-60d (+10), 14-30d (+5), <14d (0), <7d (-10) |
| **Diversity Contribution** | 0-10 | Uniqueness vs recent captions | New content type (+10), Structural variety (+5), Similar (-15) |
| **Persona Alignment** | 0-10 | Match with creator's persona | Strong match (+10), Compatible (+5), Mismatch (-10) |
| **Performance History** | 0-30 | Caption's historical earnings | Top 10% (+30), Top 25% (+20), Top 50% (+10), Below avg (-5) |
| **Send Type Compatibility** | 0-10 | Caption type matches send type | Perfect match (+10), Compatible (+5), Mismatch (-15) |

### Anti-Pattern Penalties

| Anti-Pattern | Penalty | Applied When |
|--------------|---------|--------------|
| Generic hashtags | -10 per tag | Any hashtag present |
| Emoji throw-up | -50 | 3+ consecutive same-color emojis |
| High emoji density | -15 to -30 | >10% emoji ratio |
| Missing CTA | -20 | Revenue send without action verb |
| Excessive caps | -25 to -40 | >30% uppercase |
| Copy-paste template | -100 (reject) | >90% similarity to recent caption |
| Off-brand tone | -20 | Persona mismatch flagged |
| Platform violations | -100 (reject) | Spam triggers detected |

### Total Score Calculation

```python
total_score = (
    structural_pattern_score +      # 0-30
    language_power_score +           # 0-25
    length_optimization_score +      # 0-20 (or negative if way off)
    temporal_freshness_score +       # 0-15
    diversity_contribution_score +   # 0-10 (or negative if repetitive)
    persona_alignment_score +        # 0-10
    performance_history_score +      # 0-30
    send_type_compatibility_score +  # 0-10
    anti_pattern_penalties           # 0 to -100
)

# Maximum possible: 145 points
# Minimum for selection: 50 points (threshold)
# Auto-reject: Any anti-pattern penalty of -100
```

**Selection Logic**:
1. Apply HARD FILTERS first (vault matrix + AVOID tier exclusion)
2. Calculate scores for all remaining captions
3. Sort by total_score descending
4. Select top-scoring caption that passes all gates
5. If top caption violates diversity threshold (>0.60 similarity to recent), select next best

## Anti-Patterization Safeguards

These safeguards prevent pattern over-application and maintain creator uniqueness.

### Safeguard 1: Creator-Relative Baseline

**Purpose**: Patterns are evaluated relative to each creator's top performers, not universal benchmarks.

**Implementation**:
```python
# Extract baseline patterns from creator's top 10 earners
baseline_patterns = analyze_top_performers(
    creator_id=creator_id,
    top_n=10,
    lookback_days=90
)

# Score candidate captions against creator-specific baseline
pattern_match_score = compare_to_baseline(
    candidate_caption=caption,
    baseline_patterns=baseline_patterns
)
```

**Example**:
- Creator A's top earners: Heavy emoji use, playful tone, short captions
- Creator B's top earners: Minimal emojis, professional tone, long captions
- Same caption scored differently for each creator based on their baseline

**Result**: No universal "best caption" - only "best caption for Creator X"

---

### Safeguard 2: Temporal Decay Function

**Purpose**: Patterns lose effectiveness with repeated use (audience fatigue).

**Implementation**:
```python
# Pattern decay based on recent usage
decay_multiplier = 1.0 - (pattern_usage_count * 0.15)
decay_multiplier = max(decay_multiplier, 0.3)  # Floor at 30% effectiveness

adjusted_pattern_score = base_pattern_score * decay_multiplier
```

**Decay Schedule**:
| Usage Count (30d) | Decay Multiplier | Effective Score |
|-------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| 0 (new) | 1.0 | 100% |
| 1 | 0.85 | 85% |
| 2 | 0.70 | 70% |
| 3 | 0.55 | 55% |
| 4 | 0.40 | 40% |
| 5+ | 0.30 | 30% (floor) |

**Example**:
- Alert emoji (🚨) base score: +10 points
- Used 0 times in 30d: +10 points (full value)
- Used 2 times in 30d: +7 points (70% value)
- Used 5 times in 30d: +3 points (30% floor)

**Result**: High-performing patterns don't become overused templates

---

### Safeguard 3: Weekly Diversity Gate

**Purpose**: Prevent caption similarity within same week's schedule.

**Implementation**:
```python
# Check similarity to all captions already scheduled this week
for scheduled_caption in current_week_schedule:
    similarity = calculate_similarity(
        candidate_caption,
        scheduled_caption
    )

    if similarity > 0.60:  # HARD THRESHOLD
        reject_caption(reason="Exceeds weekly diversity threshold")
```

**Similarity Components**:
- Structural similarity (40%): Pattern overlap, format, length
- Language similarity (30%): Keyword overlap, tone, vocabulary
- Emoji similarity (20%): Emoji sequence and density
- Content type similarity (10%): Same content type referenced

**Threshold**:
- >0.60 similarity to ANY scheduled caption this week = REJECT
- Forces variety even if pattern scored well

**Example**:
- Monday PPV: "🚨 43 minutes of HOTTEST B/G content 🔥"
- Wednesday PPV candidate: "🚨 38 minutes of BEST B/G action 🔥"
- Similarity: 0.72 (REJECT - too similar to Monday)
- Alternative selected with lower similarity score

**Result**: Each week's schedule has visible variety for subscriber experience

---

### Safeguard 4: Cross-Creator Uniqueness

**Purpose**: Penalize captions overused across multiple creators (generic templates).

**Implementation**:
```python
# Check caption usage across all creators in past 30 days
cross_creator_usage = count_creators_using_caption(
    caption_id=caption_id,
    lookback_days=30
)

if cross_creator_usage > 3:
    penalty = -20  # Generic template penalty
else:
    penalty = 0
```

**Penalty Schedule**:
| Creators Using (30d) | Penalty | Classification |
|---------------------|---------|----------------|
| 1 (unique) | 0 | Creator-specific |
| 2-3 | 0 | Acceptable sharing |
| 4-5 | -20 | Generic template |
| 6+ | -40 | Mass template (avoid) |

**Example**:
- Caption used by 1 creator in 30d: No penalty (unique)
- Caption used by 4 creators in 30d: -20 points (generic)
- Caption used by 7 creators in 30d: -40 points (mass template)

**Result**: Creators maintain unique voice even with shared caption bank

## Version History

### v2.0 (2025-12-22)

**Caption Bank Rebuild**

The caption_bank table was completely rebuilt with a lean schema optimized for quality over quantity.

**Schema Changes**:
- Reduced from 37 columns to 17 columns (54% reduction)
- Removed unused columns: `tone`, `emoji_style`, `slang_level`, `creator_id`, etc.
- Added new columns: `performance_tier`, `classification_confidence`, `suggested_price`, `char_length`
- Replaced `performance_score` (0-100 float) with `performance_tier` (1-4 integer)

**Performance Tier System**:
| Tier | Name | Criteria (PPV) | Criteria (Free) |
|------|------|----------------|-----------------|
| 1 | ELITE | earnings >= $500 | view_rate >= 40% |
| 2 | PROVEN | earnings >= $200 | view_rate >= 30% |
| 3 | STANDARD | earnings >= $100 | view_rate >= 25% |
| 4 | UNPROVEN | < $100 or new | < 25% or new |

**Caption Pool Changes**:
- Reduced from 59,405 to 5,541 captions (90.7% reduction)
- Focus on proven performers: earnings >= $100 (PPV) or view_rate >= 25% (free)
- Minimum sent count: 500 (statistical significance)
- Near-duplicate detection using SHA256 hash

**Classification Accuracy**:
- 5,541 captions classified by content_type and send_type
- High confidence (>=0.70): 2,279 captions (41.1%)
- Classification method tracked per caption

- `get_top_captions()` now filters by `performance_tier <= N` instead of `performance_score >= N`
- `get_send_type_captions()` updated for new schema
- `get_top_captions_by_earnings()` updated for new schema

**Impact on Scoring**:
- Performance history scoring now uses `performance_tier` (lower is better)
- New `classification_confidence` available for quality weighting
- `char_length` column enables efficient length-based filtering

## Notes

- **This document is DESCRIPTIVE, not PRESCRIPTIVE**: Patterns work differently for different creators
- **Temporal awareness is critical**: What works today may fail tomorrow if overused
- **Creator context dominates**: Always prioritize creator baseline over universal patterns
- **Anti-patterns are universal**: HARD RULES apply to all creators (no exceptions)
- **Update frequency**: Review and update quarterly based on new performance data
- **Pattern discovery**: New patterns emerge - don't limit to documented 38

**Anti-Patterization Philosophy**:
> "The goal is not to create perfect captions, but to select captions that are perfect for THIS creator at THIS moment in time, avoiding predictable templates that audiences tune out."
